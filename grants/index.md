# ACTIVE GRANTS

## METABOLOMICS

### Addressing Sparsity in Metabolomics Data Analysis
Role: Role: Multi-PI (Kechris, Ghosh); NIH/NCI U01 CA235488 2018-2022

In metabolomics data, there is sparsity in individual metabolites due to a large percentage of missing data due to biological and technical reasons,
and sparsity in connections between metabolites due to high collinearity and sparsely connected networks in metabolic pathways.
 We will develop methods and software that accounts for sparsity to maximize the potential of metabolomics data.


## CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE

### Multi-omic Networks Associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts
Role: Multi-PI (Kechris, Banaei-Kashani, Bowler, Lange); NIH/NHLBI R01 HL152735 2020-2024

To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive 
molecular multi-omic profiles from three NHLBI cohorts to discover molecular networks that are important in both 
COPD diagnosis and progression.

### Biomarker of Lung Disease in African Americans
Role: Multi-PI (Bowler, Kechris); NIH/NHLBI R01 HL137995 2018-2022

There are very few studies in COPD that address risk factors and molecular pathogenesis in African Americans.
This proposal will use three existing NHLBI cohorts to identify blood signatures that can identify who will be at risk 
for developing smoking related lung disease in African Americans.

# RESEARCH

Our group has several focus areas:
* Analyzing transcription factor binding and miRNA data to study the regulation of transcription and post-transcriptional processing,
* Examining the genetic and epigenetic factors controlling gene expression, 
* Exploring the metabolome and 
* Integrating multiple omics data.


 We also collaborate with investigators studying chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease in the COPDGene genetic epidemiology study, substance use disorders using animal models, and early life 
determinants of diabetes and obesity in children.

# GRANTS


## Definition, Etiology, Function: INtegration to Enhance Type 2 Diabetes (DEFINE T2D) Consortium  Biostatistics Research Center (BRC)
Role: Multi-PI (Kechris, Lange, Perng, Yang); NIH/NIDDK U01 DK140738 2024-2029

The BRC will work with the DEFINE T2D Cohort Sites and NIDDK to employ multi-level, multi-dimensional approaches
to characterize heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes. Establishment of the BRC and completion of the proposed goals 
will result in a broadly applicable framework for identifying type 2 diabetes subtypes and forge new research 
opportunities for effective precision interventions to prevent, reroute the clinical course, and optimize long-
term prognosis of type 2 diabetes in diverse populations.

## Multi-Omic Networks Associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts
Role: Multi-PI (Kechris, Banaei-Kashani, Bowler, Lange); NIH/NHLBI R01 HL152735 2020-2025 (NCE)

To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive 
molecular multi-omic profiles from three NHLBI cohorts to discover molecular networks that are important in both 
COPD diagnosis and progression.

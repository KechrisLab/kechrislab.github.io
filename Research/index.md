# RESEARCH

Our group has several focus areas:
* Analyzing transcription factor binding and miRNA data to study the regulation of transcription and post-transcriptional processing,
* Examining the genetic and epigenetic factors controlling gene expression, 
* Exploring the metabolome and 
* Integrating multiple omics data.


 We also collaborate with investigators studying chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease in the COPDGene genetic epidemiology study, substance use disorders using animal models, and early life 
determinants of diabetes and obesity in children.

# ACTIVE GRANTS


## Definition, Etiology, Function: INtegration to Enhance Type 2 Diabetes (DEFINE T2D) Consortium  Biostatistics Research Center (BRC)
Role: Multi-PI (Kechris, Lange, Perng, Yang); NIH/NIDDK U01 DK140738 2024-2029

The BRC will work with the DEFINE T2D Cohort Sites and NIDDK to employ multi-level, multi-dimensional approaches
to characterize heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes. Establishment of the BRC and completion of the proposed goals 
will result in a broadly applicable framework for identifying type 2 diabetes subtypes and forge new research 
opportunities for effective precision interventions to prevent, reroute the clinical course, and optimize long-
term prognosis of type 2 diabetes in diverse populations.

## Multi-Omic Networks Associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts
Role: Multi-PI (Kechris, Banaei-Kashani, Bowler, Lange); NIH/NHLBI R01 HL152735 2020-2025 (NCE)

To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive 
molecular multi-omic profiles from three NHLBI cohorts to discover molecular networks that are important in both 
COPD diagnosis and progression.


###Training Grants

## Multi-Omics and NETwork Analysis Summer Workshop (MONET)
Role: PI (Kechris); NIH/NHBLI R25 HG013296 2024-2029

The Multi- Omics and NETwork analysis workshop (MONET) will provide a 7-day immersive experience for ~25 
researchers each summer 2024-2028 to learn about multi-omics analysis and the application of network methods 
through ~50 hours of lectures, discussion sessions, computational labs, tours and team exercises.

## Colorado Biomedical Informatics Training Program
Role: MPI (Krishnan, Kechris); NIH/NLM T15LM009451 2022-2027

The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Computational Bioscience Program (CPBS) is an independent, Ph.D.-granting and postdoctoral 
training program based in the University of Colorado School of Medicine, with a 20-year track record of innovative and effective training of pre- and 
post-doctoral fellows for research careers. We are a second-generation biomedical informatics teaching program, informed by the experience of the 
many training models that have come before us. Our program is designed to produce graduates with depth in both computational methods and biomedicine, 
an intimate familiarity with the science and technology that synergizes the two, and the skills necessary to pioneer novel computational approaches 
to significant biomedical questions.

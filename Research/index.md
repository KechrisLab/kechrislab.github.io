# RESEARCH

Our group has several focus areas:
* Analyzing transcription factor binding and miRNA data to study the regulation of transcription and post-transcriptional processing,
* Examining the genetic and epigenetic factors controlling gene expression, 
* Exploring the metabolome and 
* Integrating multiple omics data.


 We also collaborate with investigators studying chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease in the COPDGene genetic epidemiology study, substance use disorders using animal models, and early life 
determinants of diabetes and obesity in children.

# ACTIVE GRANTS


## Multi-omic Networks Associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts
Role: Multi-PI (Kechris, Banaei-Kashani, Bowler, Lange); NIH/NHLBI R01 HL152735 2020-2024

To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive 
molecular multi-omic profiles from three NHLBI cohorts to discover molecular networks that are important in both 
COPD diagnosis and progression.

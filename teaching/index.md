## Multi-Omics and NETwork Analysis Summer Workshop (MONET)
Role: PI (Kechris); NIH/NHBLI R25 HG013296 2024-2029

The Multi- Omics and NETwork analysis workshop (MONET) will provide a 7-day immersive experience for ~25 
researchers each summer 2024-2028 to learn about multi-omics analysis and the application of network methods 
through ~50 hours of lectures, discussion sessions, computational labs, tours and team exercises.

## Colorado Biomedical Informatics Training Program
Role: MPI (Krishnan, Kechris); NIH/NLM T15LM009451 2022-2027

The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Computational Bioscience Program (CPBS) is an independent, Ph.D.-granting and postdoctoral 
training program based in the University of Colorado School of Medicine, with a 20-year track record of innovative and effective training of pre- and 
post-doctoral fellows for research careers. We are a second-generation biomedical informatics teaching program, informed by the experience of the 
many training models that have come before us. Our program is designed to produce graduates with depth in both computational methods and biomedicine, 
an intimate familiarity with the science and technology that synergizes the two, and the skills necessary to pioneer novel computational approaches 
to significant biomedical questions.

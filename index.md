# RESEARCH

{% capture text %}
My research focuses on the development and application of statistical methods for analyzing -omics data 
sets from high throughput technologies. I have several focus areas:

1. analyzing transcription factor binding and miRNA data to study the regulation of transcription and post-transcriptional processing, 
2. examining the genetic and epigenetic factors controlling gene expression, 
3. exploring the metabolome and 
4. integrating multiple omics data. 

I collaborate with investigators studying chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease in the COPDGene genetic epidemiology study, substance use disorders using animal models, and early life 
determinants of diabetes and obesity in children.

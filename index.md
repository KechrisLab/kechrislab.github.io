# KECHRIS LAB

Our research focuses on the development and application of statistical methods for analyzing -omics data 
sets from high throughput technologies.
{:.center}
We have several focus areas:
*  Analyzing transcription factor binding and miRNA data to study the regulation of transcription and post-transcriptional processing,
* Examining the genetic and epigenetic factors controlling gene expression, 
* Exploring the metabolome and 
* Integrating multiple omics data.
{:.center}
 We also collaborate with investigators studying chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease in the COPDGene genetic epidemiology study, substance use disorders using animal models, and early life 
determinants of diabetes and obesity in children.
